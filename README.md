# TD3

An implementation of the TD3 algorithm in pytorch. The code here is based on the work of the original authors of the TD3 algorithm found [here](https://github.com/sfujim/TD3). 

## Getting Started

These instructions will demonstrate how to setup a virtual environment with all requirements for the project setup

### Installing

```
conda env create -n rl_dev python=3.6

conda activate rl_dev

git clone https://github.com/djbyrne/TD3.git

cd TD3

python setup.py install 

jupyter notebook
```
